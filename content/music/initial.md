This would be the first edition of my music blog. To start things off, I don't try to be a critic, just sharing my experiences and tastes. I have zip musical talent so I'm just gonna share what I'm into at the time. Tryna figure out the best layout to do this, so I'll try to mix up each post a little bit.

## Year in Review
Since coming up to Rochester, NY, I haven't had the opportunity to go to as many shows as I want. When bands come up in this general area, it's eaither at Buffalo/Niagra, or Toronto. These are 2 and 3 hour drives respective. (I saw Steel Panther too, ton of fun but decently embarassed to go in depth about that band)

Back in February, we saw STRFKR perform at the [Waiting Room](http://www.waitingroombuffalo.com/) over in Buffalo. This is a band I had been listening to for about 7-8 years. I always had heard of their reputation for being one of the best bands to see live, but things always fell through when they were local. Now that I'm on co-op (internship during a semester), I could finally go.  Venue was not bad, we managed to slip up into the front left, and it soon packed in. Thankfully the venue was relatively light on the speakers as I ended up having to literally hug the speakers due to room concerns. 

STRFKR lived up to their reputation and all the hype I was building up for myself in the weeks prior.  The opener [Psychic Twin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erkqspQxjTY) was great, a trippy dream pop would be the best way I could affix a genre  to their unique sound.

#### [King Gizzard & The Lizard Wizard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUZn1I6llJs)
This band is really nutty. I've only been listening to them for about ~8 months at this point. All their albums seem to differ greatly in sound, so if one doesn't fit your taste (too up beat), another may work for you. I got into their album [Nonagon Infinity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtuBUIA6xww) which really seemed to be a huge jump in new fans for them. This album has amazing music videos that go along with it, [Gamma Knife](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC7ii3Ir-no) and [People-Vultures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f78_Tf4Tdk) where their "plots" are connected. They have a go to "relax" track for me, much different from the previous songs I linked: [The River](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUZn1I6llJs). 

Fun info: From Perth, Australia. Their frontman Stu Mackenzie is hella wacky. They plan to release 5 albums in 2017.

I saw them at [The Danforth Music Hall](http://thedanforth.com/) in the Greek City neighborhood of Toronto. First time going to Canada and it was a blast. Met some awesome Canadians that I have as show buddies from now on. Sadly had to sit up in the nosebleeds as General Admission was sold out when I found out about the show. They played a bit through their album [Flying Microtonal Banana](https://kinggizzard.bandcamp.com/album/flying-microtonal-banana) and consistently through Nonagon Infinity. I very much look forward to their next show and reccomend you see em next time they are in town.
