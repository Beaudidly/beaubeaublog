# Welcome

### Intro
I'm Austin 'BeauBeau' Bodzas, 3rd year CompSci student at the ever so chilly Rochester Institute of Technology. I have  been focusing on and interested in embedded development. Past semesters' free time has been primarily dominated by our Space Exploration student faculty research group (SPEX).  SPEX has provided me with some truly amazing opportunities for me to apply my education into projects such as  high altitude balloons and flight software for the groups [cubesat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CubeSat).

### Objective
Goal for this blog is for me to log, write about, and share my personal projects. A display of the whole process as I do it would be a great archive for going back to see how I tackled my problems in the past.  Also it would cool if I could help or inspire other ~space-hackers~ out there.

### PS
Also I'm a bit of a music listening nerd, so look in the future for "mixtapes" or playlists of what I'm currently listening to. I tend to go through genre phases that can be quite ... interesting. Taste of some genres would be shoegaze, garage rock, post rock, black metal, psychadelic, jazz, dadrock and mathrock.
